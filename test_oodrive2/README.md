### Objective

Create a to-do list application using C# and .Net.

### Brief

To better organize your daily objectives, you are going to create a to-do list application. To make it slightly more interesting, you will add functionality to track your progress over time! This will help you answer questions such as: How many tasks have you finished over a period of time? What is your most productive day of the week? How many minutes/hours/days do you need to complete a task on average?

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **C#**
    -   Framework: **.Net**
-   Your application should persist data in a database
    -   SQLite is preferred, but you are free to use a database of your choice
-   Create a to-do model. Each to-do should have a unique id, name, created_at, completed_at, and status field
    -   Implement the typical CRUD operations for this resource
-   Using a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) or .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) framework:
    -   Create a page that shows:
        -   A list of the user's to-dos with a checkbox to mark the task complete
        -   A delete button that deletes a task
        -   A simple form to add new tasks
    -   Create a simple "analytics" page that shows the number of the to-dos created and the number of the to-dos completed in a specific time frame (default last 7 days). Using query parameters, the page should accept two date ranges and filter the to-dos accordingly

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **C#** best practices
-   Use of Clean Code practices and Clean Architecture
-   Unit testing with either Xunit or Nunit framework
-   If you are using a framework, make sure best practices are followed
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?

### Note

Please take the time and try to complete all the objectives. We understand that you may not know certain technologies, but we are looking for adventurous and curious candidates willing to learn and progress.

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. 

All the best and happy coding,
